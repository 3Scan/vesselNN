# Matlab scripts

Helper scripts to support the `znn-release` 3D framework

The structure is the following:

## `3rdParty`

Contains 3rd part implementations for edge detection using Structured Forests by Piotr Dollar (https://github.com/pdollar/edges) which require the toolbox by the same author (https://pdollar.github.io/toolbox/). `densecrf` is a command-line fork from Philipp Krähenbühl which could be later updated to the Matlab wrapper by (Johannes Ulén)[https://github.com/johannesu/meanfield-matlab]. The `EvaluateSegmentation` repository contains a good collection of different quality metrics for segmentation evaluation. The `latexTable` creates automatically latex tables to be used in articles.

## `IO`
## `filters`
## `mesh`
## `metrics`
## `utils`
